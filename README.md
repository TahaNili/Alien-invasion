# We Can Make This Game Better!

Welcome to the Alien Invasion project. This is an open-source effort where serious developers, designers, and gamers come together to create something extraordinary. We’re focused on pushing the limits of what this game can be, and we need your expertise to make that happen.

The foundation is set, but now it’s time to build something even better. If you’re ready to contribute, collaborate, and help take this project to the next level, we’re excited to have you on board.
